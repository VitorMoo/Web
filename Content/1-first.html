        All our times have come
        Here but now they're gone

        Seasons don't fear the reaper
        Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain
        And we can be like they are
        Come on baby (don't fear the reaper)
        Baby take my hand (don't fear the reaper)
        We'll be able to fly (don't fear the reaper)
        Baby I'm your man

        La la la la la la
        La la la la la la

        Valentine is done
        Here but now they're gone

        Romeo and Juliet
        Are together in eternity (Romeo and Juliet)
        Forty thousand men and women everyday (like Romeo and Juliet)
        Forty thousand men and women everyday (redefine happiness)
        Another forty thousand comin' everyday (and we can be like they are)
        Come on baby (don't fear the reaper)
        Baby take my hand (don't fear the reaper)
        We'll be able to fly (don't fear the reaper)
        Baby I'm your man

        La la la la la la
        La la la la la la

        Love of two is one
        Here but now they're gone

        Came the last night of sadness
        And it was clear she couldn't go on
        Then the door was open and the wind appeared
        The candles blew and then disappeared
        The curtains flew and then he appeared (saying don't be afraid)
        Come on baby (and she had no fear)
        And she ran to him (then they started to fly)
        They looked backward and said goodbye (she had become like they are)
        She had taken his hand (she had become like they are)
        Come on baby (don't fear the reaper)
